<p>The MU School of Medicine has formed a unique partnership with CoxHealth and Mercy health systems in Springfield that will alleviate Missouri’s critical physician shortage by training more doctors to provide patient-centered care for the people of the state and beyond.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016 with the opening of a second MU clinical campus in Springfield and in 2017 with the opening of the Patient-Centered Care Learning Center in Columbia, the University of Missouri will be expanding its medical school class to provide more than 300 additional physicians for Missouri.</p>
<p>The MU School of Medicine model explicitly focuses students’ attention on the people they are preparing to serve, and students’ clinically-based education will draw on the patient-centered care provided by CoxHealth, Mercy and University of Missouri Health Care.</p>
<p>MU’s unique partnership will serve as a model for other areas of the state — and nation — that face shortages of health care professionals.</p>
